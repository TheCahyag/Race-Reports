### Training
This was my first race ever and first physical activity I've trained for. I never did any sports in high school and only started running in the summer of 2018. Running long distance is pretty new to me and only started focusing on distance around November, 2018 where at that point the longest I'd ever ran was three miles. Needless to say running 25 miles was a bit of a step up.

I did the majority of my running outside and did about 3-4 runs a week. 2-3 shorter runs in the beginning of the week and one long run on Saturday or Sunday that would be double or triple the length of the shorter runs. Each week I added a little distance to each of my runs until I was running 30-40 miles a week. On my off days I was in the gym making my quads more quadier.

Being new to distance running I had a few obstacles to overcome mostly relating to pain. The first problem I encountered was blisters after longer runs, this was a simple fix with wearing the right socks and shoes. After I made those changes, there were no more blisters, but then I started to get some intense knee pain after long runs. This lead me to focusing on my quads a few times a week as well as taking a look at my form. I'm largely still working on that last one, but it's been significantly better as of recent.

### Gear
* 2L hydration pack along with 6 Cliff Energy bars (1 for every 4 miles, ~300 calories an hour)
* Phone with battery pack for tracking my run (MapMyRun) and music
* Trekz Titanium by AfterShokz for listening to music
* Saucony Men's Liberty ISO shoes with ASICS Kayano Classic Quarter Socks

### Pre-race
Got to the site around 8AM, the race started at 10AM so I was a tad early. But I had plenty of time to assess the weather in Lockport. The weather was pretty good all things considered, it was 25 degF, partly cloudy with a slight breeze. I was incredibly nervous so I took some time just to chill and mentally prepare myself. I also double checked to ensure I had everything I needed. 

### Race
Mile 0-7: The path we were running on was pretty narrow, so the first mile or so was slow while everyone spread throughout the pathway. The first aid-station was around mile 7 and since I already had food and water on me I felt I didn't need to get anything there. Boy was that a lapse in judgement because I had forgotten I needed to check in at every aid station, yikes! I didn't realize this mistake until a couple miles down the line (more on this later).

Mile 7-13: These next few miles were mostly fine, I was starting to feel a slight pain in my legs at this point, but nothing too bad. The route of the race was such that you ran 12.5 miles one way and 12.5 miles back so around mile 10 was when runners started passing me on their way back. It made me feel super good when any of them said "Good job" or "You're doing great" as they passed me so when ever I passed someone I would say the same thing to make others feel the same way :) At mile 12.5 the next aid station station came and I made sure to check in at this one.

Mile 13-19: For the first 18 miles I was able to keep an 11 minute pace, seeing as my goal pace was 11:30 I was pretty happy how long I was able to maintain that. I was sticking to my nutrition plan thus far. I wasn't very hungry most of the time I hit my intervals to eat, but I knew I'd thank myself later and ate my energy bars anyway, haha. Unfortunately, around mile 18 is when the exhaustion and fatigue really started to hit me and I broke and had to do some walking.

Mile 19-25:
